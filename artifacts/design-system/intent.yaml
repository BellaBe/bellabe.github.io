# Typography Analysis
typography_decision:
  current_problem: |
    Instrument Serif is traditional/editorial.
    DM Sans is geometric/modern.
    JetBrains Mono is developer-focused.
    These don't share a visual language.

  personality_mapping: |
    Technical + Precise + Transparent maps to:
    - Color: Neutral, functional (current cyan works)
    - Typography: Monospace/geometric (NOT serif)
    - Spacing: Dense but clear
    - Motion: Minimal

  recommendation: |
    Option A: All geometric
    - Inter (body + headings) + JetBrains Mono (code)
    - Clean, technical, unified

    Option B: Monospace-forward (most aligned with "technical")
    - JetBrains Mono for everything (headings, body, code)
    - Extreme technical identity
    - May reduce readability for long text

    Option C: Geist family (Vercel's system)
    - Geist Sans (body + headings) + Geist Mono (code)
    - Modern tech aesthetic, unified family

    Option D: IBM Plex family
    - IBM Plex Sans (body) + IBM Plex Mono (code)
    - Technical but readable, same design DNA
