      <h3><a href="https://github.com/BellaBe/lean-os" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeanOS</a></h3>
      <p>Claude skills orchestrator for building and running businesses. 19+ specialized skills handling sales, marketing, engineering, and operations autonomously. The core principle: systems beat headcount. Instead of hiring to scale, build infrastructure that lets single founders or small teams operate with the velocity of much larger organizations.</p>
      <p>LeanOS powers both Chromly and Detekta — proving the model works across different industries (fashion tech, RegTech) with the same underlying infrastructure.</p>
