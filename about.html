  <h1>About</h1>
</section>

<article class="about-content">
  <p>I'm Bella Belgarokova. Software engineer based in Dubai, building AI systems that run business operations.</p>

  <h2>Current Focus</h2>
  <p>Building <a href="https://github.com/BellaBe/lean-os">LeanOS</a> - an AI-native operating system for small teams. The core idea: systems beat headcount. Instead of hiring to scale, build infrastructure that lets 2-3 people operate with the velocity of 10.</p>

  <p>Also working on ChromlyOS (AI fashion tech) and Detekta (regulatory compliance for GCC financial institutions).</p>

  <h2>Problems I Care About</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How to make AI actually useful for business operations (not just chat)</li>
    <li>System architecture that compounds rather than accumulates debt</li>
    <li>The build-vs-hire decision for early-stage teams</li>
    <li>Engineering precision applied to non-engineering problems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Self-taught engineer. Started in RegTech building compliance systems for financial services. Former WomenWhoCode London lead. Now focused on AI-native systems.</p>

  <p>I think in systems. I build with precision. I care about leverage.</p>

  <h2>Fractional CTO / Advisory</h2>
  <p>I help founders and early-stage teams with system architecture, technical strategy, and building AI-native operations. If you're making build-vs-hire decisions or need engineering leadership without full-time overhead.</p>
