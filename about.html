  <h1>About</h1>
</section>

<article class="about-content">
  <p>I'm Bella Belgarokova. Software engineer based in Dubai, building AI-native businesses that run on systematic infrastructure.</p>

  <h2>Current Focus</h2>
  <p>Building and running multiple ventures simultaneously using <a href="https://github.com/BellaBe/lean-os" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LeanOS</a> — a Claude skills orchestrator I created. The core idea: systems beat headcount. Instead of hiring to scale, build infrastructure that lets you operate with the velocity of a much larger team.</p>

  <p>Currently running two ventures on LeanOS:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Chromly</strong> — AI fashion tech (fit + color analysis from a selfie)</li>
    <li><strong>Detekta</strong> — AI compliance workflows for GCC financial institutions</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Both businesses share the same operational infrastructure. Sales, marketing, engineering operations — all orchestrated through LeanOS skills. This proves the model works across industries.</p>

  <h2>Problems I Care About</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>How to make AI actually run business operations (not just chat)</li>
    <li>System architecture that compounds rather than accumulates debt</li>
    <li>The build-vs-hire decision for founders and small teams</li>
    <li>Engineering precision applied to non-engineering problems</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Background</h2>
  <p>Self-taught engineer. Built systems across AdTech, FinTech, and HealthTech in the UK — A Million Ads, Sainsbury's Bank, Waracle (Roche, WellCell). Former WomenWhoCode London lead. Now focused on AI-native systems that let small teams punch above their weight.</p>

  <p>I think in systems. I build with precision. I care about leverage.</p>
