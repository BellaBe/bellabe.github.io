  <h2>The Journey</h2>
  <p>Luxury travel → self-taught engineer → startup founder.</p>

  <p>I didn't follow a traditional path. Started in hospitality and luxury travel, then taught myself to code. Built systems across AdTech, FinTech, and HealthTech in the UK. Eventually became a startup founder.</p>

  <h2>The Wall</h2>
  <p>Hit a wall with a co-founder partnership. The kind where you're waiting on someone else to execute while time bleeds out.</p>

  <p>Instead of waiting, I spent 2 months building LeanOS Pro — an AI operating system that lets me run every business function myself. Marketing, sales, engineering, operations. All orchestrated through one system.</p>

  <h2>Now</h2>
  <p>Now I build solo. One AI, every function. No dependencies.</p>

  <p>The thesis is simple: systems beat headcount. Instead of hiring to scale, build infrastructure that lets you move with the velocity of a much larger team.</p>

  <h2>Values</h2>
  <p>Proof over promises. Execution over ideas. Transparency over black boxes.</p>

    <li>Self-taught engineer. Learned by building.</li>
