<!-- Know Your Agent: The transparency differentiator -->
<section class="projects-section animate-on-scroll">
  <h2>Why "Know Your Agent"?</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p class="section-intro">Most AI tools are black boxes. You pay monthly. You can't see the prompts. You can't change them. You can't leave without losing everything.</p>
    <p class="solution-headline">LeanOS is different:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Every prompt readable</strong> — plain markdown files, no hidden instructions</li>
      <li><strong>Every skill modifiable</strong> — adapt to your domain, your workflow, your voice</li>
      <li><strong>You own it forever</strong> — one payment, no subscription, no lock-in</li>
    </ul>
