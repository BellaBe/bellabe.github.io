I spent 2 months building the AI system I wish existed. Today it's available.

---

## The Problem I Was Solving

You're probably stacking AI subscriptions. Writing tools. Sales tools. Support tools. Planning tools. Code assistants.

Different tools. Different logins. No context between them.

Your AI writing tool doesn't know about your sales conversations. Your planning tool doesn't see your engineering decisions. Each tool is a silo pretending to help while missing the bigger picture.

I was drowning in this. Two products to build. No team. Scattered context across a dozen AI tools that couldn't talk to each other.

---

## What I Built Instead

LeanOS is one AI that sees your whole business.

181 skills. 30+ agents. Strategy to execution, all connected.

Build · Sell · Serve · Plan · Grow · Think

One system. Every function. Full context.

## Know Your Agent. Own Your Agent.

Most AI tools are black boxes. You pay monthly. You can't see the prompts. You can't change them. You're renting access to someone else's decisions about how AI should work.

LeanOS is different:

- **Every prompt readable.** See exactly what's being sent to Claude.
- **Every skill modifiable.** Don't like how something works? Change it.
- **You own it.** $249 Early Adopter (first 50 buyers). Then $499. Not a subscription. Yours forever.

Transparency isn't a feature. It's the point.

## Why Now

Hit a wall with a co-founder partnership. Instead of waiting for someone else to execute, I built a system that lets me operate solo.

Two months later: LeanOS Pro.

Not a theoretical framework. The actual operating system I use daily. Every skill tested in production. Every agent solving real problems.

---

## Get Started

**Core is free.** Clone the repo, copy `.claude/` to your project, start using 15 skills immediately.

**Pro is $249 for Early Adopters (first 50).** Not $3,450/month in SaaS subscriptions. Not a recurring charge. Yours forever. After 50 buyers, price goes to $499.
