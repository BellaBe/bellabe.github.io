**Title:** LeanOS
**Description:** "LeanOS — One AI system for your entire business. 181 skills, 30+ agents. Every prompt visible. $500 once."

### What is LeanOS?
- Headline: "A complete AI system for running your business."
- Body: "Product specs. Code generation. Sales outreach. Customer health. Content creation. All in one place, all connected. When Claude sees your whole business, it produces dramatically better results."

**Build:** "Spec → production code. Design systems. Engineering handoffs."
**Sell:** "Outbound sequences. Lead scoring. Pipeline without a sales team."
**Serve:** "Customer health. Churn prevention. Onboarding automation."
**Plan:** "Market research. Business models. GTM strategy."
**Grow:** "Activation flows. Conversion optimization. Referral programs."
**Think:** "6 reasoning modes. Structured problem-solving. Decision frameworks."

### Example Skills
- Body: "181 skills means 181 specific capabilities. Here's what that looks like:"

**Sales — outreach-personalizing:**
"Takes a LinkedIn profile and your offer. Outputs a personalized message that doesn't sound like a template."

**Engineering — python-codegen:**
"Takes a spec. Outputs production FastAPI with tests, types, and documentation."

**Customer — churn-diagnosing:**
"Takes usage signals. Identifies at-risk accounts and recommends interventions."

### Why "Know Your Agent"?
- Intro: "Most AI tools are black boxes. You pay monthly. You can't see the prompts. You can't change them. You can't leave without losing everything."
- Headline: "LeanOS is different:"
- Bullet 1: "Every prompt readable — plain markdown files, no hidden instructions"
- Bullet 2: "Every skill modifiable — adapt to your domain, your workflow, your voice"
- Bullet 3: "You own it forever — one payment, no subscription, no lock-in"

## Services Page (services.html)

**Title:** Services
**Description:** "Fractional CTO for Non-Technical Founders. Technical strategy + AI-powered execution. Systems that scale without headcount."

### Hero
- Label: "Fractional CTO"
- H1: "Technical Strategy for Non-Technical Founders"
- Tagline: "Technical strategy + AI-powered execution. Systems that scale without headcount."
- Price: "Projects from $5k. Not $150-250k/year for a full-time CTO."
- CTA Primary: "DM 'CTO' on LinkedIn"
- CTA Secondary: "Or explore LeanOS"

### The Cost of Waiting
- Loss frame: "Every month without technical leadership = features shipped wrong, technical debt compounding, competitors gaining ground."
- Body: "You don't need a $200k CTO. You need CTO-level decisions now."

### What You Get

**Technical Strategy:**
"Architecture decisions, tech stack selection, and roadmap planning. CTO-level thinking without the CTO salary."

**AI-Powered Execution:**
"Faster and cheaper than agencies. AI-native workflows that compress timelines without cutting quality."

**Built for Independence:**
"No lock-in. No black boxes. Everything designed so you can take over, hand off, or scale without friction."

### Investment
- Headline: "Projects from $5k. Retainers available."
- Anchor: "Compare: Full-time CTO ($150-250k/year). Dev agency ($50-150k then they leave). Fractional: fraction of the cost, all of the strategy."
- Body: "Project-based or ongoing engagement. Flexible to your stage and needs."

### Who It's For
- "Non-technical founders with a product idea who need technical execution"
- "Need a technical partner, not a dev agency that disappears after handoff"
- "Can't afford a full-time CTO but need CTO-level decisions from day one"

### How It Works
- Headline: "Built on LeanOS:"
- "Transparent AI workflows — you see every decision, every prompt"
- "Documented architecture — nothing hidden, nothing proprietary"
- "Knowledge transfer — you can operate independently when ready"

### About Me
- Headline: "Built LeanOS Pro in 2 months — 181 skills, 30+ agents."
- Body: "Self-taught software engineer. Built systems across AdTech, FinTech, and HealthTech in the UK. Now Dubai-based, building AI-native businesses."
- Body: "I think in systems. I build with precision. I care about leverage."

### Let's Talk

## About Page (about.html)

**Title:** About
**Description:** "Bella Belgarokova — Luxury travel to self-taught engineer to startup founder. Now building solo with AI. One system, every function, no dependencies."

### Header

- H1: "About Me"

### The Journey
"Luxury travel → self-taught engineer → startup founder."

"I didn't follow a traditional path. Started in hospitality and luxury travel, then taught myself to code. Built systems across AdTech, FinTech, and HealthTech in the UK. Eventually became a startup founder."

### The Wall
"Hit a wall with a co-founder partnership. The kind where you're waiting on someone else to execute while time bleeds out."

"Instead of waiting, I spent 2 months building LeanOS Pro — an AI operating system that lets me run every business function myself. Marketing, sales, engineering, operations. All orchestrated through one system."

### Now
"Now I build solo. One AI, every function. No dependencies."

"The thesis is simple: systems beat headcount. Instead of hiring to scale, build infrastructure that lets you move with the velocity of a much larger team."

### Values
"Proof over promises. Execution over ideas. Transparency over black boxes."

### Background
- "Self-taught engineer. Learned by building."
- "UK background, now Dubai-based."
- "Global clients across AdTech, FinTech, HealthTech."

### What I'm Building
- "LeanOS — AI Operating System for Founders. Run your entire business with one AI partner."
- "Fractional CTO — Also available for advisory and technical leadership work."
